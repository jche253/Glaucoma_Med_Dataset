POAG OS>OD - in the setting of slightly thin CCT. She has glaucomatous optic neuropathy OS>OD with matching HVF defects OS>OD. While her HVF OD in 2019 appears stable, her HVF OS in 2019 appears progressed. She had some episodes of systemic hypotension during her chemotherapy in 2017, which may have contributed to her glaucoma progression. Her systemic blood pressure is now relatively stable. Given her level of optic neuropathy, I think she needs a target IOP of <18 OD and <12 OS. She is nearly at target OD and needs lower pressure OS. She is on near ***, and is s/p SLT OS. Options include maximizing topical therapy, and potentially surgical intervention, including trabeculectomy. Would prefer to maximize topical therapy prior to recommending surgery. Discussed that if surgical intervention is necessary, given her drive distance to ******** (she lives south of *****), I would highly surgery and post op care closer to home, including with Dr. ****** ******* in ***** (who ******** trabeculectomy surgeries). She agrees.  2. Cataracts OU - likely contributing to some of her symptoms of glare and night time vision issues    Start dorzolamide BID OU  Continue timolol/brimonidine combination BID OU  Continue Lumigan qHS OU  Trabeculectomy pre- and post-op information dispensed  Follow up with Dr. ****** in 1 month for IOP check (if IOP not at target, recommend trial of Rhopressa qHS)  If IOP target not reached after above, then would likely recommend trabeculectomy OS (information dispensed today)  Would be happy to see her for trab consult if necessary, though would also highly recommend Dr. ****** ******* locally for trabeculectomy consult if necessary, given reduced driving distance for surgery and post op care.        ******* *******, MD, ***  ********* ********* of Ophthalmology  Glaucoma Service  ***** *** *********   ****** ****** * ******* **********
