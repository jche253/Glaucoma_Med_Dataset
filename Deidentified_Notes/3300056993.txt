POAG OS>OD - in the setting of average CCT. His ONH OS appears glaucomatous OS and relatively intact OD. He had recent IOP spikes, which appear to have resolved on MMT topically. He does have significant VF loss OS, but much of the superior loss is likely confounded by the inferior retinal scarring. However, his HVF appear stable on recent exams. RNFL *** is less helpful given his myopic, thin, and scarred retinas. Would probably set target IOP of <21 OD and <15 OS, which he is within. SLT is an option in the future.  2.
