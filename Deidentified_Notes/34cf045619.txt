Stable   Patient essentially on maximum drops. Has had low intraocular pressures with thin corneas. OS shows superior arcuate defect that became more prominent since 2013. **-* shows that this defect is close to fixation but hasn't changed much over past yr. Up to 2015 intraocular pressures were middle to ** teens and dorzolamide added in 2016 with some improvement to mostly low double digit, occasionally lower.      Plan: will check with Dr. ******** to see if she wants to do all follow up or if she wants another glaucoma specialist involved and follow with her.  she would like glaucoma follow up as well. **** ask Dr. **** to see patient and take over, in conjunction with ****.   Schedule follow up with Dr. **** in 4 months with **-* **.    Patient essentially on maximum drops. Has had low intraocular pressures with thin corneas. OS shows superior arcuate defect that became more prominent since 2013. **-* shows that this defect is close to fixation but hasn't changed much over past yr. Up to 2015 intraocular pressures were middle to ** teens and dorzolamide added in 2016 with some improvement to mostly low double digit, occasionally lower. Now patient has had OU cataract extractions. With this and recent advance to maximum tolerated medical therapy it's reasonable to follow **-* closely. If further changes seen, may need to consider trabeculectomy, which I mentioned in 2017 upon referral to Dr. ********. However, after cataract extraction, intraocular pressure dropped to single digits for a bit and I decided to follow.              **** *. ********, M.D.  **** *. ***** ********* ** *************  ********* ******** *******  ***** *** *********  ****** ****** *** ******* **********
