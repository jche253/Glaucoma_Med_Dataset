Glaucoma Clinic Note: **/**/****    Glaucoma Diagnosis:   Referred by: No Referring Provider  POAG OU    HPI: ****** * **** ******* is a 64 y.o. female - her with husband, and guide dog *****    Here today for 3 month follow up - Can't ever tell if vision is giving trouble or other things. Has had lenses remade twice.  Had to see another optom in ****** because the prescription she had gotten from Dr. ******* wasn't good anymore.  When walks into a store, or even at home feels like walking through a ***** all of the time.  Patient has a lot of LED lights now in the ******* and finds that helpful. ******* if bad eye is interfering with things.  Balance is off, and problems with depth perception.  If doesn't have dog with her, is holding onto cane - has to use for balance.  Has gone through PT for balance/foot and still feels she's struggling.  ***** Dog people are coming back at the first of the year to follow up with her.  Rhopressa wasn't refilled by Express scripts - she received a letter that states she needs to determine coverage - wonders if maybe she was just trying to refill too soon. Ended up finding another bottle, so isn't out. *would like to know if can have a mid-day drop, sometimes supplements with cosopt, or rhopressa.
