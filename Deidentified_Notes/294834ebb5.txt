Had a bad experience with Dr. ******* - felt like he has to *** answers out of him.  "Can't do anything for you, and walked out of the room" after patient backed out of surgery. Had ***** lenses put in when he did his cataract surgery.  ******* if they could have anything to do with his vision problems.  ******* if the decline in vision is for sure from glaucoma or if it's his macular degeneration.

POAG OD>OS - in the setting of ***** CCT. He has glaucomatous optic neuropathy OU and matching HVF defects OU. He is on MMT, and s/p SLT OU. Fortunately, I don't see any evidence of VF progression on the studies provided by referring physician (2016-2018). Thus, I don't see an immediate reason for recommending surgery to lower the IOP (including trabeculectomy). Given this thicker CCT, his target IOP is probably about 15 or lower, which is essentially at today OU. If IOP becomes higher consistently, or if there is evidence of VF progression, then would recommend surgical intervention.  2. Pseudophakia OU    Continue current IOP lower regimen  Follow up with Dr. ******** locally for routine follow up and testing  RTC here if IOP becomes higher consistently, or if there is evidence of VF progression        ******* *******, MD, ***  ********* ********* of Ophthalmology  Glaucoma Service  ***** *** *********   ****** ****** * ******* **********
