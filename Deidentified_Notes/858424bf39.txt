POAG OS>OD - based on glaucomatous optic neuropathy on exam. She has thin CCT. She had significant elevated IOP OS post phaco/IOL locally. IOP today still elevated OS despite near ***. **** optimize topical therapy. Ideally, will need surgery/laser (ie cyclophotocoagulation diode laser) to lower IOP enough to a target of low teens. However, given her planned trip back to Philippines in 2 weeks for several months, surgical/laser intervention would be high risk as no follow possible. Concern for infection, bleed, inflammation, macular edema, **********, etc. without being able to return to our clinic for evaluation. Goal is to lower IOP with medical optimization and followup in Philippines with ophthalmologist for more definitive treatment.  2. Cataract OD  3. Pseudophakia OS - with Dr. ********  4.
