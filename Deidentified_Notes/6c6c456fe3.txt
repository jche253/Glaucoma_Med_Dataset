NTG/POAG OS>OD -  In the setting of unelevated IOP today and average-thick CCT. She has glaucomatous optic neuropathy OU, including a disc hemorrhage OD today. She has HVF defects OS>OD, which are progressive OS. She likely needs lower IOP OS>OD. Patient with multiple drop intolerances or documented poor IOP lowering response: latanoprost/brimonidine/dorzolamide/Vyzulta with irritation; timolol with no effect.  She also had a poor response to prior SLT OU.  Given multiple medication intolerance, prior SLT and worsening VF OS, agree with recommendation for trabeculectomy OS.  OD will need to be watched very closely with high likelihood of confirmed damage to superior nerve given disc heme OD today and if confirmed would then also likely require trabeculectomy OD after OS.   2.
