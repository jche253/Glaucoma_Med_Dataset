Glaucoma Clinic Note: */*/****    Glaucoma Diagnosis:   Referred by: ******* * ******    POAG OS>OD    HPI: ****** * ****** is a 63 y.o. male - Here today with mother  Referred for 2nd opinion of worsening vision and visual field OS, on max meds, and needs cataract removed - Dr. ****** happy to do, but says that if ****** best option for patient, it should be done here instead.  Has a history of floaters in both eyes for ~ 50 years. Patient feels SLT may have made things worse.  Has been back on Latanoprost for about 2 months - had used it a few years ago but says that was taken off for reason unknown.  Patient would like any surgery/care be done here rather than with Dr. ******'s office.  Is able to get referrals here from the VA due to where he lives. Says diagnosed with glaucoma about 2 years ago at a Costco - had gone in to get new contacts, says IOP was 28 and 29 at that point.  Took pictures and left nerve was much bigger than right.  Has been on drops since.  Is now developing cataract in the left eye and feels vision is significantly worse - feels drops are not working.  Has never been put on a drop that he was not able to tolerate. Reports very good compliance with drops.  No eye pain to report. ***** soft contacts - but not for about a year. Most recent glasses are broken, and is wearing a back up pair today - has the broken with him for his vision exam.     MD HPI: no eye pain, but has noticed vision loss OS.

POAG OS>OD - in the setting of ocular hypertension OS and about average CCT. He has glaucomatous optic neuropathy OS with matching and progressing VF defects OS. He is on MMT topically. SLT unlikely to lower IOP enough given current IOP of 31 mm Hg today. Needs surgical intervention to lower IOP and reduce risk of further vision loss. Possibilities include trab vs. ***** implant. Given travel distance and unclear visual potential, favor ***** implant (lower risk for infection and/or hypotony).  2. Cataracts OU - unclear how much cataract is contributing to visual loss OS (suspect most is due to glaucoma), but conceivable that phaco/IOL can improve limited vision remaining.  3. diabetes mellitus   4.
