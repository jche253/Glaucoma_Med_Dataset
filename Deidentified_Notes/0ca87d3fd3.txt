She is within target OD and just above target OS. She is having trouble with drop compliance using two topical drops. Adding a third drop (ie brimonidine) may cause more difficulty with adherence, than benefit. SLT is an option. Proceed with SLT OS today. If SLT not effective, would not recommend additional surgical intervention OS given limited visual potential in **.  2. Advanced Dry AMD, OU - now following Dr. ******  3. Cataract, OS -  poor visual potential given extensive GA, she prefers to defer cataract surgery for now.  4. Systemic hypotension - on oral therapy under Dr. *****'s care.
