Continue Dorzolamide/Timolol BID, OU  2. Continue Latanoprost QHS, OU  3. Clean eyelashes and lids with moist warm washcloth with baby shampoo daily  - for the time being, discontinue "Eye Relief". Increase lubrication with PFATs. Handouts given for both dry eye/MGD  4. Discussed glaucoma referral given her worsening vision, fields/downtrending GPA. Also could consider repeat SLT, adding brimonidine; pt is not currently interested in any of these options, feels there is no need to be overly aggressive. She does have ******** controlled IOP currently, so not unreasonable to focus on MGD treatment and reassess in 6 months.    Return in about 6 months (around **/*/****) for Repeat HVF, DFE (**** *****).     *, ******* *****, am functioning as a scribe for ********* * *******, MD.
