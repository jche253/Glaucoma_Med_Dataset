Would follow a bit longer - if any further field change, needs a trabeculectomy.  -  Chronic topical steroid use - per patient, has used since had severe reaction to Lumigan.  Now conjunctivitis much improved.  D/C dexamethasone - if eyes become irritated again, surgery is a better option.-Follow up 1 month to see how he does without steroids.      **/**/** IOP OD 13 OS 13 - Timoptic pres free 0.5% bid  OU-Alphagan P bid OU-travatan qhs OU-POAG OS>OD - with new, paracentral scotoma OS compared to **/****, may have occurred during IOP spike in ******** ****.-Eyes very injected off dexamethasone, likely from brimonidine though Travatan may be playing a role.
